THE WALL OF JERICHO

Jericho was among the first places on earth where this transition took place.

It was not the only farming community in the world at that date. The earliest domestication of wild cereal probably took place to the north of here, in the Karacadag mountains of Turkey, or in the Euphrates valley around the Syrian site of Tell Abu Hureyra. And there were surely other early farming villages, still unknown to archaeologists, scattered across the Levant.

At the beginning of the Neolithic era people had already been living around Jericho’s spring for centuries. Slowly, this crude encampment of brushwood huts was transformed into one of the world’s first real villages.

And then, around 10,000 years ago, the Neolithic farmers of Jericho did something absolutely unprecedented: they raised a massive stone wall around the town.

Built from stones hauled from the banks of the Jordan River more than a mile away, this wall was 4 – 5 meters high and surrounded by a deep ditch. It included a tower almost 9m tall, with an internal staircase of 22 stone steps.

Within the wall, the people of Jericho lived in circular houses made from mud brick and plaster. Inside their homes there were fire pits for cooking, and stone querns for grinding flour. If they were making bread, they may also have been fermenting grain and drinking beer. There was no pottery, but they kept seeds and pulses in baskets and skins, or in silos made from mud and straw. They stored tools here, too; spears and nets for fishing in the river, flint-tipped arrows, and sickles for reaping the fields. From the loom weights we know there were weavers among them, though the textiles made in Neolithic Jericho have all perished.

Along with the tools of everyday life, some kept more precious objects in their homes: blades made from obsidian, a glassy volcanic rock from the Anatolian mountains, and cowrie shells from the Red Sea, and pieces of turquoise from the Sinai. They must have bartered for these things with the salt and bitumen that were so abundant in their own territory, along trade routes that followed the north-south contour of the Rift Valley.

It may have been to protect of this slow accumulation of wealth that the wall was built. Kathleen Kenyon, the British archaeologist who excavated here in the 1950s, certainly thought so. Later archaeologists have suggested that it was raised to protect Jericho’s mud brick homes against floods rather than against raids, or even that the tower may have had a religious function.

Whatever its purpose, the scale and sophistication of this project displays a degree of confidence and collaboration had never been seen before. At this date, the world was still a wilderness populated mainly by tribes of hunting and foraging nomads. As they looked down on the walled city in the plain, they must have stared in wonder.
